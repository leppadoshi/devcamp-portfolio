  		<p class="lead about-text-nudge">My name is Brad, I've been developing for about a year now though I'm still hesitant to call myself a developer. I'm always trying to learn new things, whether that's more stuff for ruby/rails, javascript, angular, or even more complex things like Linux. Being able to write my own apps and programs is a huge accomplishment for me and has begun to change my life for the better.</p>
